# AI or Deep Learning Resources

## About

A curated list of deep learning articles, blog posts, papers, projects or repositories capturing the evolution of AI models; predominantly Deep Learning advancements.

This is an ongoing list and classification or survey of advancments in the AI community. It briefly elaborates notions and lists literature reviews for further exploration. The main goal of the list is to demonstrate different research fields, latest and past, and their evolution, dependence or
